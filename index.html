    <h2>Motivation Statement 🚀</h2>

    The aim of <em>PowerPlant</em> 🪴 is to use hedonistic design principles and the <em>fun</em>ctional aspect seen in
    the CopenHill powerplant 🏞 and apply them to a sanitizer 🚿 to be placed in Zachry Engineering Building.

    <h2>Week of 29th March</h2>
    <p>
    This week, we ordered the necessary materials for the prototype. In fact, some team members have spare hardware from previous projects
    available, so we did not have to order everything. We also had a meeting in which we planned in more detail the features we will build.
    In particular, we plan to have some kind of small reward for sanitizing, such as a device which responds "thanks for doing your part"
    when used or a nice animation. We also planned the logistics of when to meet and work on the following weeks' milestones.
